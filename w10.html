    <p><strong>Windows 10</strong> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer">personal computer</a> operating system developed and released by <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft</a></strong> as part of the Windows NT family of operating systems. It was released on <strong>July 29, 2015</strong>. It is the first version of Windows that receives ongoing feature updates. Devices in enterprise environments can receive these updates at a slower pace, or use long-term support milestones that only receive critical updates, such as security patches, over their ten-year lifespan of extended support.</p>
    
    <h3 class="WHO" id="WHO">Who is your OS?</h3>
    <p><strong>Windows 10</strong> will be free of charge for those running <strong>Windows 7 and Windows 8.1</strong> on their PCs, but Microsoft says that upgrading computers running the former is a priority.

The new operating system is designed to mix the familiarity of Windows 7 with modern features found in Windows 10, so for example, we get the Start menu back but with live tiles borrowed from the Windows 8 Start screen. There are plenty of new features, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortana">Cortana</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Edge">Edge</a>, a dark visual style, and a notification center, but in essence, Windows 10 is supposed to make the desktop usable once again for those with a mouse and keyboard.<br>

And as a result, <strong>Windows 7</strong> users have become Microsoftâ€™s main target for <strong>Windows 10</strong>.</p>
